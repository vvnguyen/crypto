Risks
According to Satis Group report 78% of ICOs where identified as scams, 4% failed  and 3% has gone dead. Hovewer less then 1/10 of money went to scam ICOs.[7] Another study established that half of cryptocurrency projects last only about 4 months.[8] According to Wall Street Journal there where 56 cyberattacks on cryptocurrency exchanges, initial coin offerings and other digital currency platforms.[9] In the first half of 2018 more than 760 millions of dolars in cryptocurrency where stolen from exchanges. Assuming 4bn $ of market caps for crypto this is around 20% of whole market.

Cryptocurrencies are very volatile as noted by Bank of International Settlements  2018 report [10]. Daily price can change up to 10%. By comparison fiat currencies change is few percent per month. Cryptocurrencies seems to be unreleated to macroeconomic factors. [11]

Technology
Database is organisation of data in computer in a way that allows its fast access and processing and appeared around 1960s. First databases where centralised: system used one main server or other device that stored and managed all data and multiple clients or terminals that could use data stored by server.[12] One of the first was Charles W. Bachman Integrated Database System, proposed  in 1960s. In mid 1970s first distributed databases where introduced including Australian Department of Defense database.[13] In 1981 distributed data system architecture was proposed in scientific article. [14] This was system where part of data could be stored in one place and different part on another. Later came idea how to ensure that data wont be modified easly. It has been published in 1991 by S.Haber.[15] In 1998 coinfinity later known as PayPal-company to send money online, have been established. Also in 1998 Nick Shabo introduced concept of smart contracts.[16] In 2009 Bitcoin – most popular cryptocurrency have been introduced.[17] In 2015 concept of DAG cryptocurrency have been published.
